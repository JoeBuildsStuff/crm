# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhancement adds a title field to the notes functionality in the CRM application. Currently, notes only have content, but users need the ability to add descriptive titles to better organize and identify their notes. This enhancement will improve note management and make it easier for users to quickly scan and locate specific notes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want to add titles to my notes, so that I can better organize and quickly identify specific notes without reading the full content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new note THEN the system SHALL provide a title field that accepts text input
2. WHEN the title field is provided THEN the system SHALL store the title in the database
3. WHEN the title field is empty THEN the system SHALL allow the note to be saved without a title
4. WHEN displaying notes in the table THEN the system SHALL show the title as the primary identifier
5. WHEN a note has no title THEN the system SHALL display a truncated version of the content as fallback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want to edit note titles, so that I can update and refine my note organization over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing an existing note THEN the system SHALL display the current title in an editable field
2. WHEN updating a note title THEN the system SHALL save the changes to the database
3. WHEN clearing a note title THEN the system SHALL allow saving the note with an empty title

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want to see note titles in the notes table, so that I can quickly scan and identify notes without opening them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the notes table THEN the system SHALL display the title column as the first data column
2. WHEN a note has a title THEN the system SHALL display the full title in the table
3. WHEN a note has no title THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the content (first 50 characters)
4. WHEN sorting the notes table THEN the system SHALL allow sorting by title alphabetically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want the title field to have appropriate validation, so that I can enter meaningful titles without system errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering a title THEN the system SHALL accept titles up to 255 characters in length
2. WHEN entering a title longer than 255 characters THEN the system SHALL display a validation error
3. WHEN submitting a form with an invalid title THEN the system SHALL prevent submission and show error messages
4. WHEN entering special characters in the title THEN the system SHALL accept and store them properly
